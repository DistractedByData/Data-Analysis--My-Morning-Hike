# Data Analysis: My Morning Hike

Following [yesterday's analysis](https://github.com/SoManyDistractions/Alltrails-Top-50-Hikes), where I reviewed the Top 50 hiking trails on Alltrails.com, I had another idea: why not analyze some of my own hiking data?

The opportunity was perfect as I went on a 10km hike this morning, and conveniently, I tracked the hike using the Alltrails app on my phone. This allowed me to download a CSV file of coordinates. 

I wasn't sure how many coordinates to expect, but during the analysis, I discovered that in the 1 hour and 54 minutes I was recording my hike, there were 2545 snapshots taken of my GPS position! That's a lot of data, and it should be fun to analyze and visualize.
